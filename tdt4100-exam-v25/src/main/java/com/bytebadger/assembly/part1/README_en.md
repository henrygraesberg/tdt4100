# Part 1 - Multiple choice (20%)

Bytebadger wants to ensure that you have a good understanding of the Java programming language. They have created 10 tasks to test your knowledge.

For each task, you must uncomment the correct part of the commented code to complete the exercise. **In Task 7, you will need to make some adjustments to the code**. Read the JavaDoc instructions carefully for each task to understand the intended behavior.

You will earn points for each line where you correctly removed the comment. The total points for each task are divided among the number of correct answers in that task. If you uncomment a line that should not be uncommented, you will lose the corresponding amount of points. You cannot receive less than 0 points per task.

## Tasks

* [Task 1](Task1.java)
* [Task 2](Task2.java)
* [Task 3](Task3.java)
* [Task 4](Task4.java)
* [Task 5](Task5.java)
* [Task 6](Task6.java)
* [Task 7](Task7.java)
* [Task 8](Task8.java)
* [Task 9](Task9.java)
* [Task 10](Task10.java)


## Unit tests

Two of the tasks in Part 1 are covered by unit tests.

The unit tests are located in

* [Task1Test](../../../../../../test/java/com/bytebadger/assembly/part1/Task1Test.java)
* [Task4Test](../../../../../../test/java/com/bytebadger/assembly/part1/Task4Test.java)

When the tests turn green (run without errors), it means you have uncommented the correct answer. You can run a unit test by clicking the green "Play" button when you open the test class. Remember, you can also write main methods to help you here.
